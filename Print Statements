THIS IS A SIMPLE PRINT STATEMENT

>>> print ('this is a test message')
this is a test message




HERE,WE ARE SEEING HOW TO APPEND 2 PRINT STATEMENTS

>>> print ('this is a test message' + 'ok ok, another message')
this is a test message ok, another message



HERE WE ARE SEEING HOW WE ARE USING A SEPARATOR

>>> print ('this is a test message',
	   'ok ok, another message',sep='\n')
this is a test message
ok ok, another message




HERE, WE SEE HOW TO REPEAT THE SAME VALUES USING PRINT
aname=Kumar
lname=Dilip
print(3*aname) ==> kumarkumarkumar

IT PRINTS THE VALUE OF aname 3 TIMES

print(2*aname + 2*lname) ==> kumarkumardilipdilip"
HERE, WE SEE THAT THE PRINT OUTPUTS Kumar 2 TIMES, BACK TO BACK, FOLLOWED BY dilip 2 TIMES. AS WE HAVE NOT USED SPACES, IT JUST WRITES BACK TO BACK

print(2*aname + " " + 2*lname) ==> kumarkumar  dilipdilip"
HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THE OUTPUTIS SEPERATED BY 2 SPACES




NOW, LET US SEE HOW TO RE-USE THESE VARIABLES 
a=kumar
b=30
print ('name is '+ a + ', ' + 'age is ' + str(b))
name is kumar, age is 30
HERE SEE THE OUTPUT COMES WITH ALL THE NEEDED INPUT. THE SAME CAN BE DONE USING INPUT VARIABLES WHERE WE ASK USE FOR DATA AND OUTPUT THE SAME

Name=input("Enter Your Name! ")
Age=input("Enter Your age! ")
print ("Your Name is " + Name + " and Age entered is: " + str(Age))

WHEN WE COMPILE, IT ASKS FOR NAME, ENTER A NAME, SAY KUMAR. IT ALSO ASKS FOR AGE, ENTER AN AGE, SAY 30.
output will be as below

Your Name is KUMAR and Age entered is: 30
HERE YOU MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED I HAVE TYPECASTED AGE WITH Str, BECAUSE, AGE IS A NUMBER AND REMAINING IS STRING. HENCE, WE NEED TO TYPECAST IT TO STRING. ELSE WE GET ERROR
