HERE, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO ONE OF THE LOOPING CONCEPTS TO DO A TASK REPETETIVELY.
iF LOOPS ARE USED WHERE WE WANT TO VALIDATE A CONDITION AND MAKE SURE THE CONDITION
IN THE LOOPS, INDENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. A 4 SPACE INDEDTATION TO THE CONDITION IS MANDATORY AS PER "PEP 8" STANDARD

if True:
  print("This is True condition") ==> IF THIS CONDITION TURNS TRUE, THEN THE PRINT STATEMENT IS EXECUTED
  
  
num=int(input('enter a num'))
if num==0:
	    print('its zero')

HERE, IT ASKS FOR AN INPUT. SAY, WE ENTER A NUMBER. IF THE NUMBER IS EQUAL TO ZERO, IT PRINTS "its zero"
HERE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO USE == FOR ASSIGNMENT AND NOT JUST A SINGLE =

THE IF LOOPS ONLY VALIDATES THE CONDITION TO BE TRUE

num=input("enter a number")
if num==0 or num==1:
  print("number is either zero or one")

AS WE EXECUTE THIS SCRIPT, WE ARE ASKED TO ENTER A NUMBER AND IF OUR ENTERED NUMBER IS EITHER ZERO OR ONE, WE GET THE OUTPUT AS "number is either zero or one"
IF THE ENTERED NUMBER IS ANYTHIN OTHER THAN THIS, OUTPUT IS BLANK


ELSE LOOP

num=int(input("enter a number "))
if (num==0 or num==1):
    print('its zero OR ONE')
else:
    print("this is good")
    
 HERE, IF THE ENTERED NUMBER IS EITHER 0 OR 1, IT WILL OUTPUT "its zero OR ONE", ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT WILL PRINT "this is good"
 WHAT IF WE ENTER ANYTHING OTHER THAN NUMBERS, LIKE DIGITS OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS? WELL, IT THROWS AN ERROR, BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING TO INPUT AN INTEGER TYPE, NOT A STRING TYPE.
 
 WE CAN ALSO USE MULTIPLE IF STATEMENT
 BUT, WE NEED TO USE AN ELSE TOGETHER WITH IT, ELSE, IT WILL ONLY CONSIDER THE ELSE STATEMENT OF THE NEXT AVAILABLE ONE AND EVALUATE IT
 
 num=int(input("enter a number "))
if (num==0 or num==1):
    print('its zero OR ONE')
if num==10:
    print("Entered number is ten")
else:
    print("this is good")
    
HERE, THE OUTPUT WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST 0 OR 1 AND IF ITS CORRECT, IT WILL OUTPUT "it zero OR ONE" AS WELL AS "this is good", BECAUSE THE FIRST IF STATEMENT DOESNT HAVE AN ELSE TO VALIDATE AGAINST.
IF WE ENTER THE NUMBER 10, WE GET OUTPUT AS "Entered number is ten"

SOME MORE EXAMPLES

fn=input('enter a file name')
if fn.startswith('p') or fn.startswith('P'):
    print ('FN starts with p or P')
if fn.isalpha():
    print('has alphabets only')
else:
    print('has char as wel')
if 'python' in fn:
    print('python present inside filename')
else:
    print('Name Python not present in filename')
print('closing statement')


IF-ELIF-ELSE condition

num=int(input('enter a num'))
print('before loop')
if num<0:
	    print('its negative num')
elif num==0:
	    print('non zero')
elif num >0 and num <=10:
            print('bn zero and ten')
else:
            print('more than ten')

HERE, WE ARE USING ALL THE THREE CONDITION, IF, ELSE, ELIF
IF WE ENTER NUMBER 5, ITS CHECKED IF ITS  LESS THAN ZERO OR EQUAL TO ZERO OR GREATER THAN ZERO AND ACCORDINGLY OUTPUT THE STATEMENT
