WHILE LOOP IS EXECUTED IF THE CONDITION IS TRUE

count=0   # NEED INITIATION OF VARIABLE AND VALUE ASSIGNMENT TOO HERE

while count<=10:
    print('going up' + str(count))    # NEED INDENTATION HERE. STR IS MANDATORY HERE, IF WE ARE USING ANY STRING LIKE 'GOING UP'. WE CAN ONLY USE PRINT(COUNT) TO ONLY PRINT NUMBERS
    count=count+1        # INDENTATION IS NEEDED HERE SAME AS PRINT LINE ABOVE , WE CAN USE COUNT + AS WELL. THIS CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN AS COUNT+=1
print ('done with printing')   :: PRINTS FROM 0 TO 10

OUTPUT
going up0
going up1
going up2
going up3
going up4
going up5
going up6
going up7
going up8
going up9
going up10
done with printing



count=3
while count>=-5:
print('goin up:   ' + str(count))
count=count-1   # PRINTS FROM 3 TO -5. WE CAN ALSO DO THIS BY TAKING THE COUNT VALUE AS 100 AND IN WHILE STMT USE COUNT >=90, COUNT=COUNT-1, TO GET 100 TO 90



# IF WE WANT TO PRINT ALTERNATE NUMBER, THEN WE NEED TO USE COUNT=COUNT+2. IF NEED TO JUMP 3 NUMBERS, USE COUNT=COUNT+3
# WE NEED NOT USE THE WORD COUNT ONLY. HERE, WE CAN USE A=2 WHILE A<=10: PRINT('STR(A)') A+=1

IN THE WHILE LOOP, THERE ARE 2 IMPORTANT THINGS, "CONTINUE" AND "BREAK"
CONTINUE HELPS TO LOOP IN AGAIN AND AGAIN AS LONG AS THE VALUE IS TRUE
BREAK HELPS TO COME OUT OF THE LOOP AS SOON AS IT TURNS TO BE TRUE

while True:
  name=input('Enter a name:\n')
name1='Admin'
if name.casefold()!=name1.casefold():  # THIS IS TO IGNORE CASE OF VALUE ENTERED
     print('Wrong user, type username again')   # THE PRINT STMT AND CONTINUE OF NEXT LINE ARE INDENTED SIMILARLY
        continue      # AN INDENTATION IS NEEDED. HERE, THE CONTINUE MAKE SURE THE USER NAME ENTERED IS EQUAL TO TEST ONLY
    print('Greeting the user: ',name)
    print(', Now enter your password, its a fish type... hint')
    password=input('enter password: \n')
    if password == 'bluefish':     # a : IS NEEDED
        print('Correct Login!!!\n\n')    # THE PRINT STMT AND BREAK OF NEXT LINE ARE INDENTED SIMILARLY
        break          # AN INDENTATION IS NEEDED. IF WE USE CONTINUE, IT WILL NEVER END LOOP OF ENTER NAME, IN VALIDATION AND IF IT MATCHES ENTER PASSWORD, AND LOOP BACK TO ENTER NAME

    print('access not granted to user, Try again\n\n\n')    # THE PRINT STMT ARE INDENTED SAME AS IF STMT ABOVE
