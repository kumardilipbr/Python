HERE, WE CAN SEE THE ABSOLUTE VALUE, I.E. THE POSITIVE VALUE OF A NUMBER IS TAKEN
print (abs(-55)) ==> 55



HERE, WE CAN SEE HOW THE POWER OF A NUMBER IS EXECUTED.
print (pow(3,2)) ==> i.e 3*3 = 9
pow(4,6) ==> 4*4*4*4*4*4 = 4096



HERE, WE CAN SEE THE MAXIMUM OR THE LARGEST OF THE GIVEN NUMBERS. WE CAN USE "min" ALSO, TO GET THE MINIMUM OF THE GIVEN NUMBERS
print(max(4,6)) ==> 6


HERE, WE GET THE ROUNDED VALUE OF A NUMBER TO THE NEAREST WHOLE NUMBER. DECIMAL NUMBER UPTO 5 IS CONSIDERED TO PREVIOS NUMBER AND .6 TO .9 ARE TAKEN AS NEXT NUMBER  
print(round(3.4)) ==> 3
print(round(3.7)) ==> 4



TO GET MORE DEEPER INTO MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS, WE NEED TO IMPORT math FUNCTION.

from math import * ==> WILL IMPORT ALL THE OTHER MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS

print(floor(3.7)) ==> 3 ==> DOENST MATTER IF ITS .9 OR .1, GRABS THE LOWERST NUMBER AND OMITS THE DECIMAL

print (ceil(3.7)) ==> 4 ==> THIS, ROUNDS TO THE NEXT NEAREST NUMBER, DOEST MATTER, IF ITS 3.1 OR 3.8, IT WILL ALWAYS SHOW 4

print(sqrt(36)) ==> 6.0
