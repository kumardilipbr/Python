PY supports +, -, *, /, **, //    ::: FOLLOWS PEMDAS (PARENTHESES, EXPONENTS, MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION (FROM LEFT TO RIGHT), ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION (FROM LEFT TO RIGHT).
) rule

10/3 :: GIVES DECIMAL REMINDER TOO ==> 3.3333333333333335

10//3 ==> 3

3*3 ==> 9

4**6 ==> 4096, i.e: 4*4*4*4*4*4


RELATIONAL OPERATORS ::: True is 1, false is 0
THE FOLLOWING ARE VARIOUS RELATIONAL OPERATORS GREATER THAN >, GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO >=, EQUAL TO ==, NOT EQUAL TO !=, LESS THAN < , LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO <=

THESE ALWAYS RETURNS "TRUE" OR "FALSE"

>>> True + True
2

>>> True - True
0

>>> True * True
1

>>> True - False
1

>>> False - True
-1

>>> True/False
ERROR





ORDINAL AND CARDINAL NUMBERS: HERE WE CONVERT ALPHABET TO ITS NUMBER OR VICEVERSA
ord('d')  ==> 100; ord('a') ==> 97 ;;; chr(97)==> 'a' ;chr(120) ==> 'x'




LOGICAL OPERATORS ::: AND, OR, NOT ::: 2ND EXPRESSION EXECUTES ONLY WHEN FIRST IS TRUE

EMPTY String is False,, zero is False

>>> '' or 'ty' :: HERE, THERE IS NO SPACE, ITS EMPTY, SO O/P IS 'TY'. IF THERE IS A SPACE, LIKE ' ' OR 'TY', O/P IS ' '


None – is a special object which is considered as false when it is used in conditions


>>> False==None ==> False

>>> False!=None ==> True

>>> True!=None ==> False

>>> not True   ==> False

>>> not False   ==> True 

>>> not 1  ==> False

>>> not 0  ==> True

>>> not not True ==> True
